# Static Comp 3

## Overview

I interpreted the spirit of the comp to be on an admin page for  editing a posting to be put up on a website for users to view. Staying within the same idea, I created a page that represents an admin page for editing/viewing statistics for a page on a website dedicated to recreational trail systems and their statuses.
